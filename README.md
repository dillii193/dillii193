I'm an 18-year-old B.Tech CSE student specializing in Data Science and AI at Siddharth Institute of Engineering. Passionate about technology, I love building websites, exploring cloud computing, and diving deep into data science. My ultimate goal is to secure a role at top tech companies like FAANG, where I can contribute to cutting-edge innovations. I'm constantly learning and working on projects related to AI, cloud, and web development. Feel free to explore my repositories, collaborate on exciting projects, or connect with me to discuss all things tech! ðŸš€
